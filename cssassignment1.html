    <h2>What is Css?</h2><br>
    <ol type="1" class="pg">
       <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
       <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li>
       <li> <span  id="a">Css is not neccesary </span> <span class="at" > CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
       <li> <span id="b">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span> </li>
    </ol><br>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2><br>
    <ul type="disk" class="pg">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep styles in external CSS files.  However ,<span class="at">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p class="pg">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="pg">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targated, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="pg"> There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
